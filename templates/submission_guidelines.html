<h1>Subtle Differences Recognition Challenge</h1>
        <p>The challenge consists of two tasks divided into two phases:</p>

        <h2>1) Difference Image Selection Task</h2>
        <p>The input for this task consists of two images, along with a text describing the differences between the image pair. The objective is to choose which of the two images contains a change described in the text.</p>
        <p><strong>Evaluation Metric:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Accuracy (as itâ€™s a binary classification task)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2) Conditional Difference Captioning Task</h2>
        <p>The goal of this task is to describe the minor differences in shape, color, or texture between two images.</p>
        <p><strong>Evaluation Metrics:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>BLEU-4 (measures the similarity between generated and reference captions)</li>
            <li>CIDEr (measures the similarity between generated and reference captions)</li>
            <li>GPT-4 (measures the meaning similarity over sentence structures)</li>
        </ul>

<p>Partiipants are free to participate either in both phases or just 1 of them. The phases will be evaluated separately and winners will be announced for both tasks.</p>
